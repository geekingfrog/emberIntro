# Introduction to Ember.js
This is a basic introduction to Ember.js for a [local meetup](http://www.meetup.com/javascript-enthusiasts/events/138068622/).
The final app is in final/index.html.
To run the server:

```javascript
npm install
node server.js
```

The slides for the presentation are made using [csss](https://github.com/LeaVerou/csss) by Lea Verou. It is required to have a local server to view them. The node server works fine for that too.
